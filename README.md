# UFOs
## Purpose
Provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Result
Here we can see that the more fields have been added so that we can get a clear search based on user input which makes it more accessible and friendlier to the user.

## Summary
A minor setback is the size of the dataset, which seems to be very small. Along with case sensitivity, if these 2 issues are adressed then we would be able to get a better result. We could improve this by also providing a drop down of options for users so they know the parameters.
